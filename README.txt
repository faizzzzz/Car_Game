TO RUN:
1.Python 3.6 must be installed.
2.The following libraries must be installed:
	a.pygame
	b.random
	c.schedule
	d.time
Game:
Use the arrowkeys to avoid the green blocks. Initially you will face one block. Once your score goes above 25,you wil
face 2 block. After your score goes above 100, you will face 1 red block. red blocks are faster than green blocks.

As the Levels increase, your score also increases.
Near misses gives you extra points.

Bugs:

1. file is a .py file and not an executable file(Currently, there is no method to convert a Python 3.6 .py file into an .exe file)
2. The entire code is in one file. It should be seperated into different .py files for easier management.



ENJOY!
